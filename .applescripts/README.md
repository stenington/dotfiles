# .applescripts

These are some useful scripts!

## Setup

I'm currently using [Quicksilver][qs] to set up hotkeys for these scripts. 

## Divvy

I tried a demo version of [Divvy][divvy] and thought about buying it, but
realized I could reap the main benefit (preset resizing through hotkeys) with
Applescript & Quicksilver.

Hotkeys for Divvy-emulation are:

* `Ctrl + Alt + ↑` for full size
* `Ctrl + Alt + ←` for half left
* `Ctrl + Alt + →` for half right
* `Ctrl + Shift + ←` for 2/3 left
* `Ctrl + Shift + →` for 1/3 right
* `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ←` for 1/3 left
* `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + →` for 2/3 right

## Terminal scripts

`toggle_terminal_theme` toggles between two themes with the same base name, one with
an *alt flag* appended. I like this for toggling between two versions of a theme with
and without background opacity, basically.

Hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + D`
